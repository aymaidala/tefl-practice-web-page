        <h2>
          Back in 2008, in the Highlands of Scotland, The TEFL Org was born.
        </h2>

        <p>
          After many years spent teaching English in Greece and France, our
          founders, Jennifer MacKenzie and Joe Hallwood, returned to the UK.
          They had the ambition to pass on all their knowledge and experience to
          help others to TEFL just like they had and benefit from the incredible
          opportunities it offers. From the beginning, providing the highest
          quality training, great customer service, and friendly support to new
          teachers at the start of their TEFL adventure has been at the core of
          what we do at The TEFL Org.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the last 13 years, The TEFL Org has grown rapidly to a team of
          over 40 staff and tutors passionate about all things TEFL! Along the
          way we've picked up awards, expanded worldwide, gained more
          accreditation than any other TEFL course provider, and trained over
          140,000 teachers who've gone on to teach across the globe.

            Content of the courses was good and I learned a lot but the site
            itself has some annoying bugs and it takes a while for an assignment
            to get graded. Was this review helpful?

            I found The TEFL Org to be a very professionally run organization
            that does its utmost to prepare its students to take on life as a
            teacher. They are very professional and timely in responding to
            queries and are there to help every step of the way. When I first
            began looking for a TEFL school to enroll in, I was struck by how
            many choices I had, and the widely varying price ranges. I could not
            be happier to have chosen The TEFL Org, and now that I've recently
            graduated, I'm finding their job board to be extremely useful. I
            appreciate the experience I've had with everyone I've interacted
            with at TEFL Org.

            I enjoyed the course,, i did the level 5, it as hard at times and i
            was getting bit frustrated but i did get it eventually. It was ok
            the waiting time for the tutor to mark my work as it gave me a bit
            of a break, as it is hard to read so much information and do the
            tests and assignments. so a rest was needed. no point hurrying it. I
            just now would like to get out there teaching english now to foreign
            students. to get the practise in to get better. The course is fine,,
            the tutor gives you the imput you need as best they can. So this is
            fine .My tutor was arthur he was fine. I ned to get set up now and
            work online teaching.
