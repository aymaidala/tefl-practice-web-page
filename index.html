          Org.
        </p>

        <p>
          With huge demand for English teachers across the globe there are a
          wide range of opportunities available once you're a TEFL certified
          teacher. Work in public schools, language centres, summer schools and
          universities with students of all ages and abilities. Travel to
          countries such as Spain, Japan, and Italy, or stay right at home and
          teach English online.
        </p>

        <p>
          All you need to get TEFL certified is fluency in English - no previous
          experience or qualifications required. Our courses will teach you
          everything you need to know to start teaching English for the first
          time.

          140,000 TEFL Org teachers and embark on a TEFL adventure of your very
          own.

          TEFL course, which follows the same syllabus as our in-person courses
          - the only difference is that it's delivered over Zoom. Whether you
          prefer to study in person or entirely online you will receive the same

        <h1>The TEFL Org story</h1>
        <h2>
          Back in 2008, in the Highlands of Scotland, The TEFL Org was born.
        </h2>

        <p>
          After many years spent teaching English in Greece and France, our
          founders, Jennifer MacKenzie and Joe Hallwood, returned to the UK.
          They had the ambition to pass on all their knowledge and experience to
          help others to TEFL just like they had and benefit from the incredible
          opportunities it offers. From the beginning, providing the highest
          quality training, great customer service, and friendly support to new
          teachers at the start of their TEFL adventure has been at the core of
          what we do at The TEFL Org.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the last 13 years, The TEFL Org has grown rapidly to a team of
          over 40 staff and tutors passionate about all things TEFL! Along the
          way we've picked up awards, expanded worldwide, gained more
          accreditation than any other TEFL course provider, and trained over
          140,000 teachers who've gone on to teach across the globe.

          We've been training TEFL teachers since 2008, and with over 140,000

          Digital nomad David has been travelling the world since getting
          qualified in 2015. His travels have taken him all over, to countries
          such as Japan, Mexico, Colombia, and Belarus, and along the way he's
          built a successful online teaching business.

          TEFL also allows you to work from home. Last year, Yvonne lost her job
          due to the pandemic and decided to get TEFL certified to pursue a new
          career. She's now teaching English online to Chinese children and
          loving her new job!
